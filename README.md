# iPlant

Development of an IoT solution to keep track of the plants needs and to discover their contribution in the improvement of air quality in one's home.

## Required materials

1. ESP32 Programmable board (Microcontroller/Master)
2. Raspberry PI (Server)
3. FPGA (Slave)
4. Sensor array
	- DHT11 (Temperature)
	- YL100 (Humidity)
	- MQ135 (CO2)
5. Arduino UNO (Slave)
6. Level shifter circuit (ESP32 - Arduino UNO serial connection)
